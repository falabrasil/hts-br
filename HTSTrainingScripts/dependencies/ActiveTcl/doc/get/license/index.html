Agreement is to allow ActiveState to maintain control over the
development and distribution of the Software while allowing its use in
a variety of ways. If the terms and conditions of this Agreement do

                  external-facing servers or internal-facing
                  production servers.

4.  CONFIDENTIALITY.

    a.  Except as reasonably required to exercise Your rights under
        this Agreement, You agree to prevent any unauthorized copying,
        use, distribution, installation or transfer of possession of
        Confidential Information received from ActiveState (the
        “ACTIVESTATE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION”). You will not acquire
        any interest in any ActiveState Confidential Information by
        reason of this Agreement. Nothing herein will restrict
        ActiveState’s use or disclosure of the ActiveState
        Confidential Information. ActiveState Confidential Information
        will not include any information which (i) becomes part of the
        public domain through no act or omission on Your part; (ii) is
        lawfully acquired by You from a third party without any breach
        of confidentiality; (iii) is independently developed by You
        without reference to the ActiveState Confidential Information;
        or (iv) is disclosed in accordance with judicial or other
        governmental order or timely disclosure requirements imposed
        by law or stock exchange policies. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, either party will be permitted to disclose the
        terms and conditions of this Agreement in conjunction with
        legal proceedings. Without limiting the generality of the
        foregoing, You will take reasonable steps to prevent any
        personnel from removing any proprietary or other legend or
        restrictive notice contained or included in any material
        provided by ActiveState to You.

    b.  You acknowledge that any use or disclosure of the ActiveState
        Confidential Information in a manner inconsistent with the
        provisions of this Agreement may cause ActiveState irreparable
        damage for which remedies other than injunctive relief may be
        inadequate. You further agree that ActiveState will be
        entitled to attempt to receive from a court of competent
        jurisdiction injunctive or other equitable relief to restrain
        such use or disclosure in addition to other appropriate
        remedies.

5.  OPEN SOURCE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. The Software is comprised of open
    source software, which is subject to the terms of the open source
    software license(s) accompanying or otherwise applicable to that
    open source software included in the Software (the “OPEN SOURCE
    COMPONENTS”). For reference, Tcl/Tk open source license terms can
    be found in Exhibit A attached to this Agreement or obtained from
    this link: https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/license.html. You
    acknowledge that Your own distribution or deployment of instances
    containing or linking to the Software, including the Open Source
    Components, or any other open source software may trigger open
    source license requirements for which You are responsible. Nothing
    in this Agreement limits Your rights under or grants rights to You
    that supersede the terms of any applicable open source software
    license for the applicable Open Source Components.

6.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP. All right, title and interest in
    and to the Software and all intellectual property rights embodied
    therein, including copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service
    marks, product names, trade secrets embodied in the Software's
    design and coding methodology and other proprietary materials in
    the Software belong exclusively to ActiveState or its third party
    licensors. The Software is protected by Canada and United States
    copyright laws and international treaty provisions as implemented
    locally in different jurisdictions. Except as specifically
    provided under this Agreement, You acknowledge that no other
    right, title or interest in and to the Software or any parts
    thereof is granted to You. ActiveState grants You the limited
    right to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks or product
    names of ActiveState as required for reasonable and customary use
    in describing the origin of the Software. You may not use the
    trade names, trademarks, service marks or product names of
    ActiveState in any way that might state or imply that ActiveState
    endorses Your work, or might state or imply that You created the
    Software.

7.  USER DATA. You acknowledge, agree, and expressly consent to
    ActiveState’s collection of Your User Data through the Software.
    ActiveState does not claim ownership of any User Data. You hereby
    grant to ActiveState and its sublicensees a royalty-free,
    perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, worldwide non-exclusive
    right to reproduce, analyse, review, process, diagnose, or
    otherwise use the User Data (in whole or in part) for the purpose
    of supporting, maintaining, and providing the Software, the
    Maintenance and Support, if any, and any related services provided
    by ActiveState relating to the Software (the “USER DATA LICENSE”).
    ActiveState will not disclose the User Data to any third parties
    and will only use the User Data in accordance with the User Data
    License, except that ActiveState may provide Your User Data to
    third parties providing services relating to the Software to
    ActiveState (which will protect the User Data on terms and
    conditions that are commensurate in scope with this Agreement). In
    addition to the rights granted under the User Data License, You
    acknowledge and agree that ActiveState has the right to (i)
    publicly disclose, in any manner whatsoever, User Data that have
    been anonymized; and (ii) review or analyze the User Data and
    publicly disclose any results of such review or analysis,
    including in the form of reports, blog posts, newsletters,
    marketing materials, or otherwise, provided You will not be
    identified in such publicly disclosed materials..

8.  TERM. This Agreement will be effective upon Your agreement to be
    bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will
    continue in effect unless otherwise terminated in accordance with
    the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

9.  TERMINATION. If You breach any term or condition of this
    Agreement, ActiveState may immediately terminate this Agreement
    with respect to the Software that You have licensed under this
    Agreement by providing notice to You. ActiveState may also
    terminate this Agreement, without any liability to You, if any
    law, regulations, orders, or legal requirements prohibits
    ActiveState’s provision or licensing of the Software to You. Upon
    termination of this Agreement by ActiveState, You will immediately
    cease all use of the Software and return all copies of the
    Software that are under Your control to ActiveState or to delete
    all such copies.

10.  INFRINGEMENT INDEMNIFICATION. You will indemnify, hold harmless,
    and defend ActiveState, its licensors, and their respective
    employees, agents and distributors against any and all claims,
    proceedings, demands and costs resulting from or in any way
    connected with Your use of the Software and arising from Your
    breach of this Agreement; _provided_, however, that ActiveState
    will notify You in writing of any such claim. ActiveState will not
    enter into any settlement or compromise any such claim without
    Your prior written consent. You will have sole control of any such
    action and settlement negotiations; and ActiveState will provide
    You with commercially reasonable information and assistance, at
    Your request and expense, necessary to settle or defend such
    claim.

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    a.  NEITHER ACTIVESTATE NOR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, OR
        RESELLERS MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
        UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER
        APPLICABLE LAW, ACTIVESTATE AND ITS SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND
        RESELLERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS

        DURABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, UPDATES, UPGRADES, SUPPLEMENTS, PRODUCTS, APPLIANCES,
        SYSTEM INTEGRATION, DATA ACCURACY AND ANY OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED
        HEREUNDER. ACTIVESTATE MAKES NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE THAT THE
        OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE,
        OR VIRUS-FREE, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR

        UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN
        DURATION TO THE PERIOD REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

    c.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED

    foreign agencies or authorities, and not to export or re-export
    the Software or any direct product thereof in violation of any

    that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
    "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
    documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
    1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1

    acquire the Software with only those rights as are granted to all
    other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.
    Unpublished rights are reserved under the copyright laws of Canada
    and the United States.

15. LICENSEE OUTSIDE THE U.S.  If You are located outside the U.S.,
    then the following provisions will apply: (a) Les parties aux
    presentes confirment leur volonte que cette convention de meme que
    tous les documents y compris tout avis qui siy rattache, soient
    rediges en langue anglaise (translation: "The parties confirm that
    this Agreement and all related documentation is and will be in the
    English language."); and (b) You are responsible for complying
    with any local laws in Your jurisdiction which might impact Your
    right to import, export or use the Software, and You represent
    that You have complied with any regulations or registration
    procedures required by applicable law to make this license
    enforceable.

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire
    understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter of
    this Agreement and merges all prior communications,
    representations, and agreements.

17. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is declared
    invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed modified
    to the extent necessary and possible to render it valid and
    enforceable. In any event, the unenforceability or invalidity of
    any provision will not affect any other provision of this
    Agreement, and this Agreement will continue in full force and
    effect, and be construed and enforced, as if such provision had
    not been included, or had been modified as above provided, as the
    case may be.

18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT & AMENDMENT. This Agreement constitutes the
    complete agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or
    contemporaneous agreements or representations, written or oral,
    concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, appendices and
    attachments. ActiveState reserves the right to change this
    Agreement at any time, which change shall be effective as of the
    effective date for the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
    shown on ActiveState’s Website (the “Change Effective Date”). Your
    continued use of the Software after the Change Effective Date
    constitutes Your acceptance of such changes. This Agreement may
    not be otherwise amended without ActiveState's prior written
    agreement. You agree to periodically review the terms and
    conditions of this Agreement as updated from time to time on
    ActiveState’s website.

19. ARBITRATION. Except for actions to protect intellectual property
    rights and to enforce an arbitrator's decision hereunder, all
    disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to
    this Agreement or a breach thereof will be submitted to and be
    finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the American
    Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in effect. There will be one
    arbitrator, and such arbitrator will be chosen by mutual agreement
    of the parties in accordance with AAA rules. The arbitration will
    take place in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and may be conducted by
    telephone or online. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the
    Province of British Columbia, Canada to all issues in dispute. The
    controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis,
    and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or
    controversy of any other party. The findings of the arbitrator
    will be final and binding on the parties, and may be entered in
    any court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement. Enforcements
    of any award or judgment will be governed by the United Nations
    Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
    Awards. Should either party file an action contrary to this
    provision, the other party may recover legal fees and costs up to
    $1,000.00.

20. JURISDICTION AND VENUE. The superior courts of Vancouver in the
    Province of British Columbia, Canada will be the exclusive
    jurisdiction and venue for all legal proceedings that are not
    arbitrated under this Agreement.

21. FORCE MAJEURE. Neither party will be liable for damages for any
    delay or failure of delivery arising out of causes beyond their
    reasonable control and without their fault or negligence,
    including, but not limited to, Acts of God, acts of civil or
    military authority, fires, riots, wars, embargoes, Internet
    disruptions, hacker attacks, or communications failures.
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
    either party is unable to perform hereunder for a period of
    thirty (30) consecutive days, then the other party may terminate
    this Agreement immediately without liability by ten (10) days’
    written notice to the other.

22. PUBLICITY AND AUDIT RIGHTS.

    a.  You grant ActiveState the right to include Your name, trade
        name, trademark, service mark or logo in its Software
        promotional material. You may retract this grant at any time
        in writing to_ sales@activestate.com_, requesting Your name,
        trade name, trademark, service mark or logo be excluded from
        future releases of ActiveState Software promotional material.
        Requests cannot be complied with retroactively and may require
        up to thirty (30) days to process.

    b.  If You entered into this Agreement on behalf of a Person,
        where such Person has more than 500 employees, if requested by
        ActiveState, You will furnish ActiveState with a signed
        certification (i) verifying that the Software is being used
        pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including any user
        limitations and (ii) listing the locations where the Software
        is being used. You agree to grant ActiveState reasonable
        access to Your site(s), upon prior notice during normal
        business hours, to audit the use of the Software. Any such
        audit shall be at ActiveState’s expense.

23. ASSIGNMENT. Except as expressly provided herein, neither this
    Agreement nor any rights granted hereunder, nor the use of any of
    the Software may be assigned, or otherwise transferred, in whole
    or in part, by You, without the prior written consent of
    ActiveState. Any permitted assignment by You under this Section
    will be conditional upon You delivering all copies of the Software
    to the transferee along with a copy of this Agreement, the
    transferee accepting the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
    and Your license to the Software terminating upon transfer. Any
    attempted assignment by You will be void and of no effect unless
    permitted by the foregoing. You acknowledge and agree that
    ActiveState may assign this Agreement to any third party without
    Your prior consent.

24. ENUREMENT. This Agreement will enure to the benefit of the
    parties’ permitted successors and assigns.

25. GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement will be construed under the laws of
    the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada
    applicable therein, without regard to the conflict of law rules.
    The application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for
    the International Sale of Goods and any local implementations
    thereof are expressly excluded. The parties agree that the Uniform
    Computer Transactions Act or any version thereof, adopted by any
    jurisdiction, in any form ("UCITA"), will not apply to this
    Agreement, and to the extent that UCITA may be applicable, the
    parties agree to opt out of the applicability of UCITA pursuant to
    the opt-out provision(s) contained therein.
